# Google Domains DDNS Update

I could have used an existing application but I was looking for an excuse to do something very simple that would allow me to:

1. Use Python  
2. Use GIT  
3. Use API calls  

## Pre-requisites

python requests library (install using PIP)  
python requests.auth library (install using pip)  
Domain hosted on domains.google.com  

### Deployment

Enter credentials and domain name in mycredentials.py file  
Running as a Cron Job
